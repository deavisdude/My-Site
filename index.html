				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3>Professional Stuff</h3>
				<p>I am a student/software developer from Marietta, GA with experience in multiple languages in many applications.  
				I have worked on apps, games, and even robots!  You can see some of my work on my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>. 
				I focus primarily on making video games, but I love to create things and often work on projects that are totally different. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Not Professional Stuff</h3>
				<p>I am currently a Junior in High School and I am Dual Enrolled at Kennesaw State University.  I enjoy playing video games
				(of course) and binge watching TV shows on Netflix.  As well as meeting new people and learning new things.</p>
