				<h3>Support</h3>
				<p>Support is a game that I worked on during SPSU's first summer game jam (2014).  The game was made in association
				with <a href = "http://www.jenniferann.org/">Jennifer Ann's group</a>The goal was to make a non-violent video game
				 with themes of teen mental and emotional health.  It is a 2D platformer made in Unity.  The official website for Support
				 is <a href = "http://www.support-game.com">support-game.com</a>.</p>

				<h3>TAG Society Showcase</h3>
				<p>During the summer of 2014 I did an internship for the <a href="http://www.tagonline.org">Technology Association of Georgia</a>.
				  While I was there I built an app under Heather Miner for TAG's 2015 Society Showcase, an event that is expected to have
				  thousands of attendees.  I used Apache Cordova to develop the app for both iOS and Android.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h3>Top 100 BBQ Joints</h3>
				<p>While I was an intern at TAG, I visited Atlanta Tech Village with Michael Robertson with Tag-Ed in order to talk about
				 TAG's internship program.  I met Bob Herndon from the <a href = "http://atlbbqclub.com/">Atlanta BBQ Club</a>.
				 Bob asked me to develop an app which will contain information on the Club's verified top 100 BBQ Restaurants in the 
				 United States.  This app will be ideal for people who travel in the US often and love to eat some tasty BBQ! </p>

				<h3>Pope HS Robotics</h3>
				<p>I was the lead programmer for Pope High School's FRC <a href = "http://www.poperobotics.org/">Robotics Team</a>
				during their rookie season (2013-2014).  Our robot was designed in order to catch an exercise ball with a 10 foot diameter
				 as a part of our team's strategy for that season's game <a href = "http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2014-game">Aerial Assist</a>.</p>
